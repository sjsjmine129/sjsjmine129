# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm SW Developer Eum SeungJu

- I'm a developer who is **immersed and growing** with steadiness as a weapon.
- I am working in the S/W development group of Samsung Electronics, developing Taizen applications.
- I find it rewarding to create software, and I get the greatest joy when people use the products I develop.
- I have a passion for development that led me to start my own S/W startup when I was in college.
- Currently, as a hobby and self-development, I run my own business and launch and operate my own apps.
- Use React Native and Swift to develop cross-platform and iOS apps.
- I create my own UX/UI designs using Figma and implement them in code.
- Working as an app full-stack developer for 6 months, I communicate well with backend, planning, and design staff.
- I want to make life easier with user-friendly apps.
